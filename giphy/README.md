# Challenge 1: User Interface and APIs

1. Create a page that contains a **centered** search field and a submit button with a display panel below it.
2. The panel should be **800px** wide.
3. The panel should stretch vertically to accommodate additional images as they are added.
4. Searching terms in the field should return results from http://giphy.com/ and display the images in the panel, **20 images** at a time.
5. Scrolling to the bottom of the page should **automatically** return the next 20 results and append them to those already returned without reloading the page.

- implement infinite scroll library?

6. Searching a new term should **reset** the results.
7. Your project should be coded in **React** Web with **Redux** highly encouraged and testing highly encouraged. Documentation for the giphy API can be found here: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/.
