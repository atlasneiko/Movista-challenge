# Challenge 2: PHP

- Create a function that finds and returns the first occurrence of the longest word in a given string.
- Additionally, there should be a line of code that calls the function and then prints out the result.
- For example, given the string “I love Cats”, the function should return the word “love”. While “love” and “Cats” have the same number of characters, love is the first occurrence of a longest word in the string.
